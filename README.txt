### Contributers
* Iliana Barrera
* Andres Abrego

## Usage
### Requirements
* [StarUML 2](http://staruml.io/) - Used for UML class models

### Running
All Java source code required is contained in the /src directory.

There are two main entrypoints;
* GKSServer.java - Runs the server for the system
* GKSClient.java - Rund the employee client

It is required that the server is running before the client can connect.

### Current Functionality
* Basic framework of all classes with getters, setters, and methods required for implementation
* Primitive client-server communication

## TODO
* Assign Karts Functions
* Assing drivers to karts Function
* Schedule drivers
* Full functionality of the client/server models
* Determine client-server comm. protocol
